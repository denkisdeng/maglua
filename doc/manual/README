These files create an example-based manual for MagLua. `GenerateManual.lua' 
is the driver program and all the other Lua scripts define documented tasks.

To generate the documentation, run:

	maglua GenerateManual.lua *.lua

This will create an `index.html' along with supporting files for each task.
