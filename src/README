* What is MagLua?
  ---------------
  MagLua is an extension to the base Lua language that allows a user to build
  micromagnetic simulations in the Lua scripting language.

  MagLua is composed of 3 conceptual parts:
    * Data -        Spin vectors and fields, these are held in a SpinSystem.
    * Operators -   Objects which calculate fields based on spins or external 
                     influences such as Anisotropy, Dipole, Thermal, etc.
    * Integrators - Objects which update spin orientations based on calculated
                     effective fields. Different integrators can be created 
                     using LLG.

* Installation
  ------------

  MagLua can be built using "make", "make install" will copy the binary to
  your ~/bin directory. MagLua makes use of Modules installed in a module 
  directory. The module directory is read from a startup file. To create 
  the startup file(s) run MagLua giving the location of the directory

    maglua --setup MODULE_DIRECTORY

  where MODULE_DIRECTORY is a place where you will install the modules.

  Once MagLua is compiled, installed and the startup files are created, 
  the modules may be built and installed. In the included subdirectories
  type "make install". This will place the created modules in a common
  directory.


* Documentation
  -------------
  A the command line switch "-h" and "--help" will print information about
  command line options and how to correctly cite the code. 

  MagLua has build in documentation. An HTML file can be built with command

     maglua --write_docs maglua.html
 
  to generate the help file. 

  Information on the Lua scripting language can be found at www.lua.org
