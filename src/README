* What is Maglua?
  ---------------
  Maglua is an extension to the base Lua language that allows a user to build
  micromagnetic simulations in the Lua scripting language.

  Maglua is composed of 3 conceptual parts:
    * Data -        Spin vectors and fields, these are held in a SpinSystem.
    * Operators -   Objects which calculate fields based on spins or external 
                     influences such as Anisotropy, Dipole, Thermal, etc.
    * Integrators - Objects which update spin orientations based on calculated
                     effective fields. Different integrators can be created 
                     using LLG.

* Installation
  ------------
  Maglua can be built using "make" in 3 different ways:
    * "make serial"   - builds the serial version of Maglua
    * "make openmp"   - build the parallel OpenMP version of Maglua +
    * "make mpi"      - build the parallel MPI version of Maglua +

  Once it is built, you can install maglua with "make install" this will place 
  any of the 3 executables in your ~/bin directory. Make sure this directory
  is in your $PATH.

        + Experimental

* Documentation
  -------------
  Maglua has build in documentation. An HTML file can be built with the 
  supplied script "help.lua". Run it with "maglua help.lua" to generate
  the help file. 

  Information on the Lua scripting language can be found at www.lua.org
